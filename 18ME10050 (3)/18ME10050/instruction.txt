1. The dataset(filtered and unfiltered) are given in the "dataset" folder
2. The codes can be run using the usual "python <filename.py>"
3. The predicted csv files are present in predictions folder
4. The libraries used for this assignment are 
	csv
	pandas
	numpy
	string
	sklearn
	gensim
	fasttext
	
5. For task2 I have used the adaboost classifier of sklearn library
	An AdaBoost classifier is a meta-estimator that begins by fitting a classifier on the original dataset and then fits additional copies of the classifier on the same dataset but where the weights of incorrectly classified instances are adjusted such that subsequent classifiers focus more on difficult cases. This class implements the algorithm known as AdaBoost-SAMME
